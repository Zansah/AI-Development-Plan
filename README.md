# AI Developer Mastery Journey
**A Personal Roadmap from Beginner to AI Engineer**

This repository documents my complete learning path in artificial intelligence, from the first steps in Python programming to developing advanced machine learning and generative AI systems.  
It serves as both a portfolio of my work and a structured learning log reflecting progress, insights, and growth over time.

## Purpose and Approach

**Mastery over speed.** I only move forward when I fully understand the concepts behind what I’m building.  
The goal of this journey is not to rush through technologies, but to develop deep, practical fluency across every stage of AI development — from math and programming to deployment.

Each level in this roadmap includes:
- Core learning topics  
- Hands-on projects  
- Skill checklists  
- Lessons and notes  
- GitHub-ready deliverables
